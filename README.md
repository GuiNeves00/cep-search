Searches for given CEP on ViaCEP's api, then write all CEPs on a JSON file.

Last challenge from one of Alura's Java course. It was only required from us to consume the API once, writing only 1 CEP inside the JSON file.

I decided to expand a little more to solidify the knowledge, by creating a CEP class ready to receive more behaviours, and by making possible to write as much CEPs as one would want in the JSON file.
